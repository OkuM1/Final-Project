# Final-Project-Idea #

This project was intended for CS50 but eventually got too big in scope and put on halt for now.

A computer-vision project implemented into pygame.

The user interacts with a camera and the hands are renderes as skeletons on a black screen. 

-> Putting your index finger and thumb together enables the user to draw lines.

Could be a game (guess what i am drawing?) , used for research purposes or even a interesting way to write messages.
